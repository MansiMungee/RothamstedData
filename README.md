Temporal Biodiversity trend analysis using 50 year count data from across multiple locations, and multiple insect groups. Framework: Heirarchical Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) to characterize seasonality, other non-linearity and disentangle the relative contributions of multiple environmental covariates (predictors)

Notwithstanding the reports of dramatic insect declines from around the world (Hallmann et al., 2017; Lister & Garcia, 2018; Sánchez-Bayo & Wyckhuys, 2019), we know very little to assess the generality of the rate, magnitude and extent of insect declines (Didham et al., 2020; Montgomery et al., 2020; Wagner 2020). Identifying the ‘which taxa’ and ‘in which region’ remains a key challenge to accepting or refuting the popular but contentious ‘global’ insect decline narrative. 

World’s standardized long-term monitoring networks have played an instrumental role in providing some of the most persuasive evidence for shifts in insect communities and populations over time (Szentkirályi et al. 2007; Seibold et al. 2015; Bell et al. 2020; Gillespie et al. 2020; Wagner 2020). 

Here, I use 50-year historical data from the Rothamsted Insect Survey suction traps - the worlds longest standardized insect monitoring program, which maintains a network of suction traps at multiple locations throughout the UK (Shortall et al., 2009; Bell et al., 2020). 

I use these data to test two hypotheses regarding the generality of insect community temporal trends: 

1. First, I test the hypothesis that community trends diverge between different insect groups at the same location, and for the same group at different locations. This is because insect responses to environmental change can have strong geographical variation at the spatial scale of the different suction traps (Stenseth et al. 2002; Forister et al. 2010), and strong taxon-dependent variation across multiple insect groups, and be highly specific to the habitats occupied.
    
2. Second, I test the hypothesis that despite diverging patterns across habitats and taxonomic groups, the patterns are driven by a same, common set of overarching predictors, and the spatial- and taxonomic-complexity in insect temporal trends is driven by the spatial complexity in these underlying set of predictors.
